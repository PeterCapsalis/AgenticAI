# AgenticAI
A repository to capture my experiments using LLMs and Langgraph for AgenticAI

This includes:
- Building an AI Agent to run Machine Learning Models using Langgraph: uses a llama3.2:1b model with Langgraph to train and call a linear regression model to perform point prediction and understand the features.
